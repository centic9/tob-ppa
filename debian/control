Description: Small yet powerful program for tape oriented backups
 tob is a simple yet configurable shell-script which, given a set of 
 `volume definitions', runs tar or afio based backups, either for use 
 with tape drives or floppy disks. You could also mount and unmount 
 partitions for backups in the pre- and post-commands. tob is a general
 driver for the making and maintaining of backups.  It makes full 
 backups, differential backups (of the files which were changed since 
 the last full backup), incremental backups (of files changed since all
 previous backups), lets you determine the size of the backup before 
 actually making it, maintain listings of made backups, make remote 
 backups and possibly more.
