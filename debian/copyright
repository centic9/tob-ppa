This is Debian Linux's prepackaged version of the tob utility. Tob is a
driver for the making and maintaining of (tape-oriented) backups. It was
written by Karel Kubat <karel@icce.rug.nl>. It is now maintained upstream by 
Stephen van Egmomd <svanegmond@tinyplanet.ca.

This package was put together by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
from the sources from ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/tob-0.14.tar.gz.
The following changes were made 
	* adding the Debian package maintenance system 
	* adding a manual page were made.
	* small changes in /sbin/tob to better match FSSTND 
See the file /usr/share/doc/tob/Changelog.debian for details.
Current sources are available at http://tinyplanet.ca
