Subject: Bug#71116: wishlist: keep a record of deleted files?
Date: Thu, 07 Sep 2000 17:41:55 -0400

Package: tob
Version: 0.14-18
Severity: wishlist

When doing differential or incremental backups, would it be difficult
to have tob generate a list of files that are in the previous backups
but don't exist on the disk anymore?  This would allow the user to
restore a filesystem precisely, by untarring each tar file and
then removing all files that are listed in the last deletions file.

E.g.:

root.full.tar
root.diff.tar
root.diff.deletions (files in root.full.tar, but not on disk)
root.inc.tar
root.inc.deletions (files in root.full.tar or root.diff.tar, but not on disk)

I currently almost exclusively do full backups because I want to be
able to restore things exactly, if necessary;  an option like this
would let me do differential and incremental backups more often,
which would be excellent.

Thanks for such a useful program.  I use it very often on all the
machines I administer.

Dan
