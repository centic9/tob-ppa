This is tob, the Tape Oriented Backup.  Hope it's useful.

REQUIREMENTS

tob uses a separate archiver to do its work.  The stock, recommended,
configuration uses 'afio'.  We suggestion at least afio 2.4.8.

Other archivers that are known to work include tar and arj; please
see the sample-rc directory for examples.

You also need bash, sed, and other standard Unix tools.


INSTALLATION

Debian: 
	apt-get install tob

Manual:
	cp tob /usr/local/sbin
	mkdir /etc/tob
	mkdir /etc/tob/volumes
	cp tob.rc /etc/tob/tob.rc
	cp example.* /etc/tob/volumes

Red Hat:
	rpm -ta tob-*.tgz
	rpm -i tob*.rpm


Test your installation by typing:
	tob -full example
	tob -verify example

There are manual pages available in the archive, which should
be put into /usr/local/man/man8.
