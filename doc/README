In this directory you'll find miscellaneous docs: the formatted manpages for
afio and mt, and the output of "tar --help". Hope that it's of some use to
you.

Also, I've put the file "tob-and-mt.tex" here, a LaTeX2e document that was sent
to me by Lars Otto (lars@dina.kvl.dk). It describes how you can use mt to
position tapes, so that you get more backups on one tape.

In a similar vein, Patrick D'Cruze (pdcruze@orac.aust.li.org) sent me an
excerpt from the ftape install guide. It describes filemarks on tapes, so I've
included a part from that mail in "filemarks.doc". See if you can use it to
your advantage. Patrick finishes with: "I hope it applies to qic-02 tapes as
well.." I have no idea, try it out.

Finally, "remotebackups.txt" is some info by S. Zunft on usernames when
running remote backups. See if you can use it.

Karel.
