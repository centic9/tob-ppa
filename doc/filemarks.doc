A short introduction to file marks:
===================================

  File marks are written to tape to separate individual files (Note
that one `tar' file may contain many data files!). So several
files can be written to tape and individually retrieved.
  The way ftape implements these file marks allows almost random
access to individual files (instead of sequentially reading the
entire tape until ones finds the right file mark).

  Every time the device is closed after writing some data two file
marks are written to tape. If the non-rewinding device is used the
tape is rewound so it is positioned right between these two marks.
  If another file is written to tape the second marks is overwritten
but the first stays causing succeeding files to be separated by
exactly one file mark.

  The following should make this clear: After writing one file to the
non-rewinding tape device the tape layout will be:

        <file-1> <eof> <eof>

  When another file is written the layout will be:

        <file 1> <eof> <file 2> <eof> <eof>


  If we want to add another file to this tape after it has been
rewound, there are to options: First to skip 2 file marks to position
right between the last two marks. In this case we have to know how
many files to skip.
  The other solution is to seek for the double file mark and position
in between. This is done with `mt eom'.
  Remember to use the non-rewinding device when positioning the tape
or it will be rewound when closing !

  Appending a file to a tape:

        mt -f /dev/nftape eom
        tar cvf /dev/ftape <files>

  Reading the first and third files from tape:

        mt -f /dev/ftape rewind
        tar xvf /dev/nftape
        mt -f /dev/nftape fsf 2
        tar xvf /dev/nftape

  The best way to understand what is happening is to picture the tape
layout and count the file marks that have to be skipped.


BTW: Keep in mind that file marks aren't written to tape until the
     header segment is updated. For non-rewinding devices this will
not happen automatically: Make sure that either the last write is to
a rewinding device or issue an `mt rewind' or `mt rewoffl' to flush
the buffers. The last command will put the drive offline until you
reload the cartridge (or the driver). While the drive is offline all
commands will fail.
