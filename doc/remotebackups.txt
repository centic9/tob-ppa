Subject: tob:remote backup


Hey Karel,

first, I find tob a useful tool for comfortable backups.

Here some remarks concerning the remote backup:

* There's no need to "su" to another user on the local machine: An adequate
  "$HOME/.rhosts" -entry (lets say for the user "tape") on the target machine 
  should be sufficient. As an example:

  cat /home/tape/.rhosts
     machine_to_be_backed_up.domain  root

  This allows root on 'machine_to_be_backed_up.domain' a rsh on the target
  machine.

* With a gnu-versions of tar or cpio and the above '$HOME/.rhosts' -entry 
  a remote backup is even still simpler:
	
     BACKUPDEV="tape@targetmachine.domain:/dev/rmt0"

  (This is how I backup my Linux-box to a tape connected to 
  an AIX-Tapeserver.)
  The tar command starts the "rmt"-command for the user "tape" on 
  the remote machine via rsh and pipes the stream into it. rmt is 
  usually in /etc and that's where tar looks for it. (However, the 
  tar that comes with Slackware-Linux expects it to be in /sbin. 
  In this case one needs an appropriate link on the the target machine
  or a different tar.) Maybe afio has a similar feature.

Maybe this is of help to you. If not, simply forget it.
